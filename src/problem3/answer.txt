1. Unused Variables (rest)
rest is extracted from props but never used.

2. Using any for blockchain Type
- The getPriority function accepts any, which defeats TypeScript's type safety.
- Should use an enumeration (enum) instead.

3. Logical Error in sortedBalances Filtering
- The filter function contains a reference to lhsPriority, which is undefined in this context.
- It attempts to check if balance.amount <= 0 but incorrectly nests conditions, making the logic unclear.

4. Sorting Function Without a Return Value
- The sort function should return 0 when values are equal, ensuring a proper comparison.

5. Inefficient Sorting Strategy
- filter and sort should be merged into a single reduce operation to improve performance.

6. Incorrect Type for formattedBalances
- formattedBalances maps over sortedBalances but doesnâ€™t explicitly convert it to FormattedWalletBalance.

7. Unnecessary Double Mapping
- The formattedBalances array is created but not used in rows, causing redundant computation.
